Projeqt Wordpress Plugin that adds oEmbed and Shortcode support

== Description ==
Dynamic presentations for a real-time world
With Projeqt, your presentations never remain static. Grab your old dusty presentations, or create one from scratch with our user-friendly dashboard, and let your stories free. By pulling live tweets or blog feeds, inserting an interactive map, adding audio notes or simply streaming videos that you've found on the web - they can all live in real-time and be shared for everyone to see. Let your presentations be as dynamic as you are.
